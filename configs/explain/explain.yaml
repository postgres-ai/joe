  - code: "SEQSCAN_USED"
    name: "SeqScan is used"
    description: "Consider adding an index"
    detailsUrl: "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/understanding_explain_plans.html#optimising-queries"
  - code: "TOO_MUCH_DATA"
    name: "Query processes too much data to return a relatively small number of rows."
    description: "Reduce data cardinality as early as possible during the execution, using one or several of the following techniques: new indexes, partitioning, query rewriting, denormalization. See the visualization of the plan to understand which plan nodes are the main bottlenecks."

  - code: "ADD_LIMIT"
    name: "Add LIMIT"
    description: "The number of rows in the result set is too big. Limit number of rows."

  - code: "TEMP_BUF_WRITTEN"
    name: "Temporary buffers written"
    description: "Raise `work_mem` (currently, the recipe is: `exec alter system set work_mem to '100MB'`, then `exec select pg_reload_conf()`)"

  - code: "INDEX_INEFFICIENT_HIGH_FILTERED"
    name: "Specialized index needed"
    description: "The index(es) currently used does not serve quite well for the needs of this query (notice `Rows Removed by Filter: ...`, meaning that the index fetched many non-target rows). Consider adding more specialized index(es)."

  - code: "VACUUM_ANALYZE_NEEDED"
    name: "VACUUM ANALYZE needed"
    description: "Visibility map(s) for the table(s) involved in the query are outdated. For better performance: 1) run `VACUUM ANALYZE` on them as a one-time solution, 2) perform autovacuum tuning as a long-term permanent solution (tuning \"vacuum\" part of autovacuum)."
