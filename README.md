# Joe - Postgres Query Optimization
Boost your backend development process

![Joe Bot demonstration](./assets/demo.gif)

Provide developers access to experiment on automatically provisioned
production-size DB testing replica. Joe will provide recommendations
for query optimization and the ability to rollback.

## Status

The project is in its early stage. However, it is already being extensively used
in some teams in their daily work. Since production is not involved, it is
quite easy to try and start using it.

Please support the project giving a GitLab star (it's on [the main page](https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/joe),
at the upper right corner):
